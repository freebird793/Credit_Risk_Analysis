# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Project Overview
The objective of this challenge was to create a supervised machine learning model that could accurately predict credit risk. The given data is found in the loan_statsQ19.csv file.

## Results

I used six different machine learning methods to analyze our data.

Naive Random Oversampling:
Balanced accuracy score of 65%
High risk precision of 1% with a sensitivity of 73%
Low risk precision of 100% with a sensitivity of 68%

SMOTE Oversampling:
Balanced accuracy score of 64.5%
High risk precision of 1% with a sensitivity of 63%
Low risk precision of 100% with a sensitivity of 66%

Cluster Centroid Undersampling:
Balanced accuracy score of 64.4%
High risk precision of 1% with a sensitivity of 61%
Low risk precision of 100% with a sensitivity of 45%

SMOTEEN Sampling:
Balanced accuracy score of 53%
High risk precision of 1% with a sensitivity of 70%
Low risk precision of 100% with a sensitivity of 57%

Balanced Random Forest Classifier:
Balanced accuracy score of 68%
High risk precision of 88% with a sensitivity of 37%
Low risk precision of 100% with a sensitivity of 100%
